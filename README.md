# Paper-Focus-Mode
Stay in the zone on Paper

Avoid a nervous breakdown at the sight of your boss viewing that important Paper doc you're still working on with Paper Focus Mode. When Focus Mode is installed, the Paper facepile turns entirely grayscale so you don't have to worry about someone breathing down your neck wondering about that upcoming deadline or unanswered question. Whether it's a big project proposal or new growth strategy, edit the Paper doc to your heart's content regardless of who's watching.
